                    Engineering</strong> in <strong>Skopje</strong>,
                    <strong>North Macedonia</strong> and studying in the field of <strong>software engineering</strong>.
                    As for future endeavours I hope of

                    software and games.

                As of now I have learnt many of skills through my studies at FCSE some of them including writing short
                programs in C, C++ and Java to learn the fundamentals of programming. I have also tried my hands on web
                development with the likes of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript making static and dynamic websites.
                In recent of times I am working on understanding the concepts of game development with the usage of
                Unity and the language C# as well as working on breaching the server side of web development with the
                likes of ASP.NET and MVC. As for IDEs that I am familiar with are CodeBlocks, CLion, WebStorm, Atom,
                Rider, IntelliJ and Visual
                Studio.
